# **Very Detailed Front-End Development Checklist**

Below is a **very** comprehensive front-end-only checklist that breaks down each user story from the plan into small, one-story-point tasks. These tasks adhere to **atomic design principles** (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates/Pages) and incorporate the **cursorrules** provided. Each section includes **Storybook** story tasks for thorough UI coverage. **No back-end tasks** are listed here; this is purely for front-end development.

## **EPIC A: Starter Repository & Project Setup**

### **Story A1 – Clone Starter Repository (UI Perspective)**

> **Goal**: Provide a UI flow that allows the user to see or trigger the repo clone process (though actual cloning logic is handled elsewhere).

Below is a very detailed markdown numbered list broken down into story point tasks with substeps as checkboxes. Each top-level item represents one story point that an AI coding agent can work on:

1. **Set Up Project Infrastructure**

     - [ ] A thumbnail image with appropriate alt text.
     - [ ] Tech stack badges or icons.
     - [ ] A brief summary describing the project, Umut’s role, and the outcome.
   - [ ] Implement an expand/collapse mechanism or navigation to dedicated project detail pages.
   - [ ] Add hover animations using Framer Motion for interactive feedback on project cards.
   - [ ] Ensure the layout adapts for both grid display on desktop and a vertical list on mobile.
   - [ ] Integrate external links (e.g., a “View Live” demo) with proper `target="_blank"` and security attributes.

6. **Develop Blog Section**
   - [ ] Create a Blog Listing Page that displays posts in reverse chronological order.
   - [ ] Design each blog post preview to show the title, publication date, brief excerpt, and tags.
   - [ ] Add a sidebar or header with a short author bio and optional tag filters.
   - [ ] Develop individual Blog Post Pages with:
     - [ ] A title, publication date, and author information.

    - [ ] Finalize deployment and verify that all functionalities (SEO, performance, accessibility) are optimal.

This comprehensive checklist can now guide an AI coding agent (or development team) to incrementally build out Umut Temel’s personal website according to the detailed specification.

# **Final Notes**

1. **No Backend Work**: All tasks above focus purely on front-end UI building and Storybook stories.
2. **Atomic Design Approach**: We create smaller components first (atoms), combine them into molecules, then form organisms, and finally place them in pages/templates.
3. **Storybook Coverage**: Each component has a dedicated `.stories.tsx` file in `src/stories`. We demonstrate multiple states and use `@storybook/blocks` or autodocs as configured.
4. **Next Steps**: Once these are completed, the AI agent or dev team can tie in backend logic (Prisma, tRPC, Git ops, AI calls, etc.) to make these interfaces functional.

> **This checklist ensures that each user story has front-end tasks broken into one-story-point increments.** Feel free to adjust exact naming or folder structure as your project demands, but the fundamentals remain the same. Good luck building the **Forq App** front-end!
